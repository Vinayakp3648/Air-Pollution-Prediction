# Air-Pollution-Prediction
Humans can only survive because of air. Its quality needs to be seen and understood for our own wellbeing. Air pollution causes physiological issues and respiratory mortality in millions of people globally. Air pollution is the largest environmental concern, according to scientists. The rapid industrialization has led to the discharge of harmful gases, which has considerably accelerated the rate of population growth. The air is contaminated with hazardous substances that are detrimental to human health. The quality of the air has drastically decreased due to uncontrolled pollution. The Air Quality Index (AQI) is used to measure and report air pollution levels.  The twelve parameters (air pollutants) that are used to calculate the AQI are NO2 (nitrogen dioxide), SO2 (Sulphur dioxide), CO (carbon monoxide), O3 (ozone), PM10 (particulate matter with a diameter of 10 microns or less), PM2.5 (particulate matter with a diameter of 2.5 microns or less), NH3 (ammonia), and benzene. In other applications, the six pollutants PM10, PM2.5, SO2, NO2, CO, and O3 are used to calculate the air quality index (AQI).
